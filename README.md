# Detecting Solar Panels From Satellite Imagery

## content
The goal of this analysis is to detect solar panels in aerial imagery data. The MIDS team was given a series of image files. The goal is to develop a machine learning technique that is able to make a binary decision: is there a solar panel in the image?

## contribution
Through this project I completed the follwoing tasks: access aerial imagery data, process the data into a form to ready it for machine learning algorithms, train and test multiple supervised learning techniques, and evaluate the performance of the algorithms. A well-written report was composed and uploaded to this repository. 

## language
Python

## tool stack

CNN, Computer Vision
